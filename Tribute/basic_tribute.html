        <h2>The True Meaning of Love</h2>
        <br>
            <p>I thought long and hard on who I feel I should do a tribute page for.  I wanted to pick someone that I knew, someone who 
                has affected my life personally, someone I admired.  This woman, who is now 56 years old, isn't exactly perfect in
                all matters of life.  I mean who is?  She mothered me in her high school years and honestly every year on my birthday
                I personally thank her for letting me live.  I thank my grandmother, RIP, for being her full support during the pregnancy.
                My mother didn't necessarily get to live her teenage years as most teenagers do.  She had all 5 of her children with 3 
                miscarriages by the age of 25. Yes, that is alot of children, but she always showed us true love and sacrifice, even as a young mother.
